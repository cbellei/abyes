aByes
^^^^^^^^^^^^
aByes is a Python package for Bayesian A/B Testing, which supports two main decision rules:

* Region Of Practical Equivalence (as in the paper `Bayesian estimation supersedes the t-test <http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/articles/Kruschke2013JEPG.pdf>`__, J. K. Kruschke, Journal of Experimental Psychology, 2012)
* Expected Loss (as discussed in `Bayesian A/B Testing at VWO <https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/310840/VWO_SmartStats_technical_whitepaper.pdf>`__, C. Stucchio)

A lot of the underlying theory is discussed in `this blog post <http://www.claudiobellei.com/2017/11/02/bayesian-AB-testing/>`__.

Installation on a Vertex.ai Workbench
============
* Spin up a new user managed notebook: https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/ (TODO: Terraform + docker image, this will replace the install steps below)
* Connect to the notebook
* Install abyes

```
# Open a terminal. 
git clone https://github.com/cbellei/abyes.git
cd abyes
make init
```
* Restart the notebook kernal (under `Kernel` menu)
* To check that the package has been installed, in the Python shell type::

        import abyes

* If everything works correctly, the package will be imported without errors.

Dependencies
============
* aByes is tested on Python 3.5 and depends on NumPy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Pymc3 (see ``requirements.txt`` for version
information).

How to use aByes
================
The main steps to run the analysis of an A/B experiment are:

* Aggregate the data for the "A" and "B" variations in a List of numpy arrays
* Decide how to do the analysis. Options are: 1. analytic solution; 2. MCMC solution (using PyMC3); 3. compare the analytic and MCMC solutions
* Set decision rule. Options are: 1. ROPE method; 2. Expected Loss method
* Set parameter to use for the decision. Options are: 1. Lift (difference in means); 2. Effect size

These and many more examples and instructions can be found in this blogpost.

Example
=======
* In IPython, type::

    import abyes as ab
    import numpy as np

    data = [np.random.binomial(1, 0.4, size=10000), np.random.binomial(1, 0.5, size=10000)]
    exp = ab.AbExp(method='analytic', decision_var = 'lift', rule='rope', rope=(-0.01,0.01), plot=True)
    exp.experiment(data)

* This will plot the posterior distribution:

   .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cbellei/abyes/master/abyes/examples/example.png

* It will then give the following result::

    *** abyes ***

    Method = analytic
    Decision Rule = rope
    Alpha = 0.95
    Rope = (-0.01, 0.01)
    Decision Variable = lift

    Result is conclusive: B variant is winner!

* There are many more examples available in the file ``example.py``, which can be run from the root directory with the command::

    python abyes/examples/examples.py

Limitations
===========
Currently, aByes:

* only focuses on conversion rate experiments
* allows for only two variants at a time to be tested

These shortcomings may be improved in future versions of aByes. (Feel free to fork the project and make these improvements yourself!)
